### Module setup

BEGIN {
    use Exporter ();
    our ($VERSION, @ISA, @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK, %EXPORT_TAGS);

    # Version checking
    $VERSION = '0.1.5';

    @ISA = qw(Exporter);

    @EXPORT = qw(
    );

    @EXPORT_OK = qw(
        &Move_File
    );

    %EXPORT_TAGS = (
        'functions' => [qw(&Move_File)],
        'vars' => [qw()],
    );
}

### Exported package globals

# None

### Non-exported package globals

# Thread-safe? What's that? Package global error value. We don't export
# this directly, because it would conflict with other modules.

our($Error);

### File lexicals

# None

### Constant functions

# None

### Meaningful functions

# Move_File($orig, $new, $mode)
#
# Move an file from $orig to $new by copying, and set the file mode
# of the new file according to the variables given.
#
# Returns 1 if successful, 0 if not (and sets $Error)

sub Move_File {
    my($orig) = shift(@_);
    my($new) = shift(@_);
    my($mode) = shift(@_);

    if (!copy($orig, $new)) {
        $Error = $!;
        return 0;
    }

    if (!chmod($mode, $new)) {
        $Error = $!;
        return 0;
    }

    if (!unlink($orig)) {
        $Error = $!;
        return 0;
    }
