### Module setup

BEGIN {
    use Exporter ();
    our ($VERSION, @ISA, @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK, %EXPORT_TAGS);

    # Version checking
    $VERSION = '0.1.5';

    @ISA = qw(Exporter);

    @EXPORT = qw(
    );

    @EXPORT_OK = qw(
        %ComponentDB
        &Open_Databases
        &Close_Databases
        &Get_Version
        &Set_Versions
    );

    %EXPORT_TAGS = (
        'functions' => [qw(&Open_Databases &Close_Databases &Get_Version
                           &Set_Versions)],
        'vars' => [qw(%ComponentDB)],
    );
}

### Exported package globals

# I'd love to be able to do this as a hash of hashes of hashrefs, but the
# database layer can't handle it. So we have multiple DBs.

# VersionDB - hash of tied hashes, keyed on Distribution (then Source
# package). Keeps track of all versions. Prior to 0.2.2, the value pointed
# to was a scalar representing the version of the source package; as of
# 0.2.2 and later, updated records are hashrefs pointing to hashes that
# have package -> version mappings, with 'source' being the key for source
# package version.

our(%VersionDB);

# ComponentDB - hash of tied hashes, keyed on Distribution (then Source
# package). Stores the component data for the given package.

our(%ComponentDB);

### Non-exported package globals

# Thread-safe? What's that? Package global error value. We don't export
# this directly, because it would conflict with other modules.

our($Error);

### File lexicals

# None

### Constant functions

# None

### Meaningful functions

# Open_Databases()
#
# Open all tied NDBM hashes for each real distribution. Returns 0 in the
# case of errors opening hashes, 1 otherwise.
