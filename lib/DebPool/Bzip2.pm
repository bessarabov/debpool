### Module setup

    our ($VERSION, @ISA, @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK, %EXPORT_TAGS);

    # Version checking
    $VERSION = '0.1.5';

### Exported package globals

### Non-exported package globals

# Thread-safe? What's that? Package global error value. We don't export
# this directly, because it would conflict with other modules.

our($Error);

### File lexicals

# None

### Constant functions

# None

### Meaningful functions

# Bzip_File($file)
#
# Generates a bzipped version of $file, and returns the filename. Returns
# 0 (and sets $Error) on failure.
