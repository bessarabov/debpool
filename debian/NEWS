debpool (0.2.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * A major change (support for automatic section detection) has been
    introduced between version 0.1.11 and version 0.2.1. This change
    causes a change in archive directory layout (specifically, now has a
    subdirectory for each of the sections defined in the config file),
    making it look more like the traditional Debian archive. Existing
    installations will need to do one of two things to cope with this:

      1) Move each package directory into the new pool area, and update any
      *.package and *.source files to have the correct path to the new pool
      area, then run debpool --rebuild-files,

    or

      2) Start a new archive area and dump installed/* and pool/*/* into
      the incoming directory, optionally pare out redundant versions, and
      then run 'debpool' to re-build the archive.
