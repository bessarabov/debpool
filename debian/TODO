Features, fixes, and other stuff to be done.

(general)

* Parse_DSC and Parse_Changes need to handle multiline entries better.
* Support tools for manipulating metadata (which really means 'anything
  stored in database files').
* Support rebuild-dbs (including invocation from rebuild-all)?
  - What can this do with stuff that has migrated between distributions?

(package uploads)

* Fix package uploads for different cases, such as:
  - allow uploading same version but disallow change of orig file.
  - allow uploading same version but disallow uploading earlier version.

(package removal)

* Allow package removals through a simple command and/or signal to debpool

(package migration)

* Implement package migration between different sections.
  - For example, migration from unstable to testing.

(config file)

* Some way to double-parse values in $archive (allowing the equivalent of
  relative path references from archive_dir, so that changes are reflected
  in all other paths by default).

(documentation)

* Include examples of using gnupg-agent with debpool.
* Improve the "multiple debpool" documentation.

(email)

* Implement email notifications.
  - (Bug #293054).

(archive diff support)

* Support Packages.diff, Sources.diff, and Contents-<arch>.diff files.
  - Should probably use 'diff --ed' as diff is an essential package anyway.
  - (Bug #323041).

(hooks)

* Hooks
  - Installation
  - Rejection
  - Byhand (with some sort of requeue? Or "byhand MUST be missing"?)

(gamin support)

* Support gamin (useful for non-Linux ports).

(signed deb files)

* Integrate with (or emulate) debsig-verify, to allow for verification of
  signed deb files (in addition to signed metadata).
  - This probably won't happen anytime soon as there's little support for signed
    deb files.

(remove .package and .source metadata from database)

* Use another method to retrieve package metadata instead of using these files.
