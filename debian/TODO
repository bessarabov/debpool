Items which still need to be done:

(general)

* Support tools for manipulating metadata (which really means 'anything
  stored in database files').

* Support rebuild-dbs (including invocation from rebuild-all)?
  - What can this do with stuff that has migrated between distributions?

(for debian-installer support)

* Handle udeb packages correctly (entries go into
    dists/<dist>/<section>/debian-installer/<binary>/Packages instead of
    dists/<dist>/<section>/<binary>/Packages)

(for hooks)

* Hooks
  - Installation
  - Rejection
  - Byhand (with some sort of requeue? Or "byhand MUST be missing"?)


(for sane binary-all)

* Support an external source for binary-all data (for example, snarfing it
  out of a Packages file from http.us.debian.org).

(unknown)

* Integrate with (or emulate) debsig-verify, to allow for verification of
  signed deb files (in addition to signed metadata).

* Some way to double-parse values in $archive (allowing the equivalent of
  relative path references from archive_dir, so that changes are reflected
  in all other paths by default).
