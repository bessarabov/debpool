Basic instructions for setting up a system-wide debpool archive with a
debpool user/group:

1. Create a debpool user and group by using the command:

   adduser --system --group --shell /bin/bash
   --gecos 'Debian Pool Manager' debpool

   (Note that the command should be entered on one line; it is broken into
   two parts for the ease of reading).

2. If you do not wish to use /var/cache/debpool (the default location), you
   must create a directory where you want the archive to be placed, and set
   it's user/group appropriately. For example:

   sudo mkdir /export/debpool
   sudo chown debpool:debpool /export/debpool
   sudo chmod a+rx /export/debpool

   If you do wish to use /var/cache/debpool, it will need to be made
   accessible to the debpool user and group. The only supported method of
   doing this is to use dpkg-statoverride, as follows:

   dpkg-statoverride --update --add debpool debpool 0755 /var/cache/debpool

3. Create a logfile directory for debpool. The two most common choices are
   /var/log/debpool (which mimics normal "system" log behavior), or
   /home/debpool/.debpool (which mimics user-installation log behavior
   on a default Debian system setup). Note this location for use in step 4.

   For example:

   sudo mkdir /var/log/debpool
   sudo chown debpool:debpool /var/log/debpool
   sudo chmod a+rx /var/log/debpool

4. Edit /etc/debpool/Config.pm. The following items are of particular note:

   * archive-dir (the archive directory chosen in step 2)
     - You may wish to double-check the *_mode settings as well
   * log_file (should reside in the directory chosen in step 3)

   Run debpool once, to check that all of your configuration values are
   correct, and to create the directory structure. For example:

   sudo su - debpool /usr/bin/debpool

5. Edit the crontab for user debpool, using the command:

   sudo crontab -u debpool -e

   You should add one of the following two sets of crontab entries to the
   file, depending on how you want to run debpool:

   (Periodic mode; example fires off hourly, at 13 minutes past the hour)

   @reboot         /usr/bin/debpool --nodaemon
   13 *   * * *    /usr/bin/debpool --nodaemon

   (Daemon mode; fire off only on restart. Note that this should all be one
   line, without the \, prefferably)

   @reboot         /usr/bin/debpool --daemon

   Note that the command line options given here will override any other
   configurations, including those found in /etc/debpool/Config.pm,
   ~/.debpool/Config.pm, and the default configurations.
