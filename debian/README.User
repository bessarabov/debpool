Basic instructions for setting up a system-wide debpool archive with a
'debpool' user/group:

1. Create a debpool user and group by using the command:

   adduser --system --group --shell /bin/bash \
      --gecos 'Debian Pool Manager' debpool

   (Note that the command should be entered on one line; it is broken into
   two parts for the ease of reading).

2. If you do not wish to use /var/cache/debpool (the default location), you
   must create a directory where you want the archive to be placed, and set
   it's user/group appropriately. For example:

   mkdir /srv/debpool
   chown debpool:debpool /srv/debpool

   If you do wish to use /var/cache/debpool, it will need to be made
   accessible to the debpool user and group. The only supported method of
   doing this is to use dpkg-statoverride, as follows:

   dpkg-statoverride --update --add debpool debpool 0755 /var/cache/debpool

3. Edit /etc/debpool/Config.pm. The following item is of particular note:

   * archive-dir (the archive directory chosen in step 2)
     - You may wish to double-check the *_mode settings as well

   Run debpool once, to check that all of your configuration values are
   correct, and to create the directory structure. For example:

   su - debpool /usr/bin/debpool
