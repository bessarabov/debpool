Description: Debian package archive maintenance utility
 DebPool is a package archive maintenance utility. It is designed with the goal
 of keeping the number of dependencies down to a minimum. It is intended to be
 a lightweight replacement for the full Debian archival scripts, in the
 tradition of debarchiver and mini-dinstall, but using a pool layout and
 avoiding external dependencies.
 .
 It is capable of all of the following:
   * Tracking multiple distributions (however, it does *not* include
     unstable -> testing promotion scripts).
   * Generating Release files
   * Verifying package signatures (requires gnupg).
   * Signing Release files (requires gnupg).
   * Running in single-pass or daemon modes.
   * Process incoming packages using Inotify.
