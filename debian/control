Description: pool-based Debian package archiver
 DebPool is a package archive maintenance utility designed with a goal of
 removing any dependency on code not shipped as part of the core Debian
 system.
 .
 It is capable of all of the following:
   * Tracking multiple distributions (however, it does *not* include
     unstable -> testing promotion scripts).
   * Generating Release files (requires libdigest-sha-perl)
   * Verifying package signatures (requires gnupg).
   * Signing release files (requires Release files and gnupg).
   * Running in single-pass or daemon modes.
   * Process incoming packages using Inotify (requires liblinux-inotify2-perl)
 .
 DebPool is intended to be a lightweight replacement for the full Debian
 archival scripts, in the tradition of debarchive and mini-dinstall, but
 using a pool layout and avoiding external dependencies.
