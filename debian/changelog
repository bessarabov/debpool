debpool (0.2.3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Handle sections with no subsection more usefully in
    Strip_Subsection. (Closes: #317390, #319959)
  * Refactor various bits to use Strip_Subsection, rather than re-
    implementing it badly. I don't know what on earth I was thinking,
    but things should behave better now. (Closes: #320062)
  * Don't hardcode the pool base path as 'pool'; determine it from
    archive_dir and pool_dir, instead. (Closes: #323625)
  * Updated to Policy 3.7.2.0 (no changes).
  * Moved dependancy on debhelper from Build-Depends-Indep to Build-
    Depends (to shut up various build tools).

 -- Joel Aelwyn <fenton@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Jul 2006 12:08:12 -0600

debpool (0.2.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Handle stripping of epoch versions where they aren't used.
  * Properly handle each possibly version type (meta or 'package'
    version, source version, binary version(s)). This change is
    backward-compatible, but old version information will only work as
    well as it did in previous releases (that is, all of the versions
    are assumed to have the same value for a given package version).

 -- Joel Aelwyn <fenton@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Feb 2005 10:47:20 -0700

debpool (0.2.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added proper support for archive sections (contrib, non-free as
    separate from main). Unfortunately, this means changing the
    directory structure of the pool area. Thus, bumping to version to
    0.2.x
  * Rewrite and re-enable auditing of package area when a new version is
    installed (or, in short, 'discard old package versions').
  * Make the GnuPG module dynamically detect the GnuPG header, as it
    already did for the trailer, rather than always assuming it is a
    single size. While I can't replicate the situation, it appears to
    not be true on some architecture/version combinations.
    (Closes: #294945)

 -- Joel Aelwyn <fenton@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Feb 2005 13:27:09 -0700

debpool (0.1.11) experimental; urgency=low

  * Handle origional tarballs more strictly; if the Changes file claims
    to have one, treat it as the only valid source; if not, treat the
    pool as the only valid source. (No bug)
  * Added support for virtual distributions (testing-volatile, unstable-
    ganneff, etc) which are remapped to normal distributions at upload.
    (Closes: #275642)
  * Support Section and Priority fields for Source packages (uses the
    values found on the DSC file line in the Changes file). (No bug;
    TODO)
  * Fixed a couple of problems that occured when sign_release was
    enabled. I don't know what I was smoking when I wrote those bits of
    code, but it must have been good. (Closes: #291809)

 -- Joel Aelwyn <fenton@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Jan 2005 23:46:59 -0700

debpool (0.1.10) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fixes for incorrect information in README.User (Closes: #291151)
  * Added timestamp to log entries. (Closes: #291055)
  * Fixed bad built-in default value for sleep time in daemon mode (was
    0, should have been 300 seconds / 5 minutes). (Closes: #291152)
  * If we reject a package, skip to the next one; everything else is
    pointless (and will just generate useless errors in the logs). (No
    bug)
  * Added special case handling for DSC file MD5Sum validations; the
    orig tarball is allowed to appear in this file, but must be checked
    in the pool, rather than in the incoming directory, if it already
    exists. (Closes: #291036)

 -- Joel Aelwyn <fenton@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Jan 2005 14:28:27 -0700

debpool (0.1.9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Correct the fact that the debhelper control file debpool.docs was
    completely missing. Definite oops. Also, move 'README' to
    'README.Debian' for general consistance with other packages, as this
    is Debian-specific information. (Closes: #285751)

 -- Joel Aelwyn <fenton@debian.org>  Wed, 12 Jan 2005 22:45:00 -0700

debpool (0.1.8) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fixed a regex bug in Packages module which caused things to fail
    when a dpkg info field was only 1 character long (most often
    Installed-Size: 0, or at least < 10). (Closes: #274060)

 -- Joel Aelwyn <fenton@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Oct 2004 19:06:58 -0600

debpool (0.1.7) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix documentation bug regarding command-line options.
    (Closes: #257447)
  * Include README files in docs. (Closes: #254301)
  * Updated maintainer name (same person, legal name change only).
  * Fixed call from Logging to DB::Close_Databases problem when trying
    to bail on fatal logging errors so that it works now, rather than
    producing a secondary error. (Closes: #275760)
  * Include .dsc file information in Sources records. (Closes: #276232)
  * Fixed a reported typo in an error message in the GnuPG module.
    (Closes: #271529)
  * Fixed an improperly bound call to Release::Install_Release in the
    case of a failed GnuPG signature on the Release file.
    (Closes: #254300)

 -- Joel Aelwyn <fenton@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Oct 2004 15:29:51 -0600

debpool (0.1.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * Forcibly protect + characters when dealing with regex matching.
    Oops. (Closes: #248189)
  * Fixed problem with not reporting the (optional but very important if
    present) Essential header. Based on patch submitted by Frederick
    Schueler. (Closes: #248766, #248585)

 -- Joel Baker <fenton@debian.org>  Fri, 14 May 2004 09:25:42 -0600

debpool (0.1.5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Cope properly with things when package filename version numbers do
    not match source version numbers (anything with an epoch, and some
    oddities like gcc-defaults). (Closes: #245180)
  * Switch away from trying to move files at all, even using
    File::Copy's move - too many issues with it. Use a copy/chmod/unlink
    series (wrapped up in DebPool::Util::Move_File) instead.
    (Closes: #247191)
  * Generate distribution top-level Release files, including optional
    signatures. (Closes: #247025)
  * Switch to using File::Temp for tempfile management, since it is in
    the standard core as of 5.6, so we can depend on it being present,
    and it's much cleaner than using Fcntl and tmpnam to manually do the
    same. (No bug specifically against this, but it should fix the
    'Subroutine O_*' error messages reported in bug #245180).

 -- Joel Baker <fenton@debian.org>  Thu,  6 May 2004 16:13:15 -0600

debpool (0.1.4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Handle non-existant distributions correctly. (Closes: #245132)
  * Fork to avoid reader deadlocks when running external processes via
    open2. I'd prefer threads, but I don't trust perl's threading much.
    (Closes: #245843)
  * Fix serious issue with dropping the first entry in the changes file.
    (Closes: #245896)

 -- Joel Baker <fenton@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Apr 2004 20:36:15 -0600

debpool (0.1.3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Handle binary-only uploads correctly. (No bug filed)

 -- Joel Baker <fenton@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Apr 2004 17:02:43 -0600

debpool (0.1.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Print a separator newline after every package in the Packages file,
    not after every set of packages. (No bug filed)
  * Use the package name, not the source name, when trying to scan for
    the upload file. Duh. (No bug filed)
  * Removed an erroneous error logging message; it really is OK to have
    some architectures without some packages (in particular, binary-*
    and 'all' should never occur together).

 -- Joel Baker <fenton@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Apr 2004 16:39:40 -0600

debpool (0.1.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Updated to Policy 3.6.1 (no changes).
  * Fixed use of deprecated hashref semantics.
  * Use non-deprecated perl version requirement form.
  * Package file entries should no longer run together; stupid error
    printing to the wrong file handle. (Closes: #242435)
  * Use File::Copy::move() instead of rename() when moving files, to
    deal with cross-filesystem moves properly. (Closes: #230510)
  * Switched from Build-Depends to Build-Depends-Indep; not sure if I
    agree this makes sense, but linda is being loud about it, so.

 -- Joel Baker <fenton@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Apr 2004 11:12:30 -0600

debpool (0.1.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial upload (to experimental). (Closes: #200654)

 -- Joel Baker <fenton@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Oct 2003 09:16:09 -0600
