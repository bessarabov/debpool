Important notes about using debpool:

* For archives using any of the extended features (in particular, any of
  the GnuPG-based signature verification or Release signing capabilities),
  it is strongly advised that you run debpool under it's own user. See
  README.User for more information on doing this.

* For setting up signature verification or Release signing, please see the
  README.GnuPG file.

Dependencies:

* One of the goals of debpool is to keep the amount of dependencies down to a
  minimum. The idea with this is so debpool would be able to run on different
  ports of Debian (such as on freebsd). With this in mind, the dependencies for
  debpool are essentially Perl, other Perl modules, and a C compiler.

  With other Perl modules, careful consideration is taken to pick out a module
  that isn't too complex. For example, libproc-daemon-perl depends solely on Perl,
  which is why it is allowed as a dependency. libcompress-bzip2-perl depends on
  Perl, libc, and libbz2. The dependencies of Perl and libc are ok. The
  dependency of libbz2 had to be checked further. It turned out that libbz2
  just needs libc to run and gcc to build (aside from texinfo for documentation)
  therefore in this case, libcompress-bzip2-perl was allowed as a dependency for
  debpool.
