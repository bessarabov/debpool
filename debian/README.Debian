Important notes about using debpool:

* For archives using any of the extended features (in particular, any of
  the GnuPG-based signature verification or Release signing capabilities),
  it is strongly advised that you run debpool under it's own user. See
  README.User for more information on doing this.

* For setting up signature verification or Release signing, please see the
  README.GnuPG file.
