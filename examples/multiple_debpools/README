Packages Built for Different Distributions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Users of other archive managers may have used a setup where they
were allowed to upload packages of the same version for multiple
distributions. The behavior in debpool however is that it will
keep the last package that was uploaded (when the 'rollback'
option is set) for a particular distribution, if it's using the same
version from another upload to a different distribution.
This is because of the nature of a pool based archive manager,
where all files for a package are kept in the same directory.

For anyone wanting to use debpool to host a repository of their
packages for multiple distributions, one way to do this is to add
a '~distro1' to the version of their package. For example, for a
package 'foo-1.0-1', the package can have its version set as
'1.0-1~etch1' to specify that it's a package built for Debian etch.
If a package gets accepted into Debian, the extra tag can be removed,
the packages reuploaded, and any users of the repository will receive
a notice that an update is available from the debpool repository.
(See Debian Policy 5.6.12 on why/how this would work.)

Another way to use debpool for packages built for different distros
is to use different directories that will contain its own debpool
setup. This can be useful for anyone who maintain packages for both
Debian and another OS distribution (like Ubuntu). The example
configuration file, init script, and default configuration file from
this directory can be used for such a case. Rename the distro part of
the files to the distro they'll be used for and change the variable
used to set the distribution in the files to the distro they'll be used for.
(The configuration file may need more modification.)
